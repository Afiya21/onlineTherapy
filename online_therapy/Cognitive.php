                <h1>What Is Cognitive Therapy?</h1>
                <p>  
                        Cognitive therapy (CT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment that helps people learn how to identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on behavior and emotions.
                        
                        Cognitive therapy focuses on changing the automatic negative thoughts that can contribute to and worsen emotional difficulties, depression, and anxiety. These spontaneous negative thoughts have a detrimental influence on mood.
                        
                        Through CBT, these thoughts are identified, challenged, and replaced with more objective, realistic thoughts.<br> <br>
                        
                        <h2>Types of Cognitive Therapy</h2>
                        CBT encompasses a range of techniques and approaches that address thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. These can range from structured psychotherapies to self-help materials. There are a number of specific types of therapeutic approaches that involve CBT, including:
                        Cognitive therapy centers on identifying and changing inaccurate or distorted thinking patterns, emotional responses, and behaviors.2
                        Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) addresses thoughts and behaviors while incorporating strategies such as emotional regulation and mindfulness.
                        Multimodal therapy suggests that psychological issues must be treated by addressing seven different but interconnected modalities: behavior, affect, sensation, imagery, cognition, interpersonal factors, and drug/biological considerations.3
                        Rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) involves identifying irrational beliefs, actively challenging these beliefs, and finally learning to recognize and change these thought patterns.
                        While each type of cognitive behavioral therapy takes a different approach, all work to address the underlying thought patterns that contribute to psychological distress.
                        
                        <h2>Techniques</h2>
                        CBT is about more than identifying thought patterns; it is focused on using a wide range of strategies to help people overcome these thoughts. Techniques may include journaling, role-playing, relaxation techniques, and mental distractions.4
                        
                        <h3>Identifying Negative Thoughts</h3>
                        It is important to learn how thoughts, feelings, and situations can contribute to maladaptive behaviors.5 The process can be difficult, especially for people who struggle with introspection, but it can ultimately lead to self-discovery and insights that are an essential part of the treatment process.
                        
                        <H3>Practicing New Skills</H3>
                        It is important to start practicing new skills that can then be put in to use in real-world situations. For example, a person with a substance use disorder might start practicing new coping skills and rehearsing ways to avoid or deal with social situations that could potentially trigger a relapse.
                        
                        <h3>Goal-Setting</h3>
                        Goal setting can an important step in recovery from mental illness and helping you make changes to improve your health and life. During CBT, a therapist can help with goal-setting skills by teaching you how to identify your goal, distinguish between short- and long-term goals, set SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time-based) goals, and focus on the process as much as the end outcome.
                        
                        <h3>Problem-Solving</h3>
                        Learning problem solving skills can help you identify and solve problems that arise from life stressors, both big and small, and reduce the negative impact of psychological and physical illness.
                        
                        <h3>Problem solving in CBT often involves five steps:</h3>
                        
                        Identifying a problem
                        Generating a list of possible solutions <br>
                        Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each possible solution<br>
                        Choosing a solution to implement<br>
                        Implementing the solution<br>
                        Self-Monitoring<br>
                        Also known as diary work, self-monitoring is an important part of CBT that involves tracking behaviors, symptoms, or experiences over time and sharing them with your therapist. Self-monitoring can help provide your therapist with the information needed to provide the best treatment. For example, for people coping with eating disorders, self-monitoring may involve keeping track of eating habits as well as any thoughts or feelings that went along with consuming that meal or snack. </p>
