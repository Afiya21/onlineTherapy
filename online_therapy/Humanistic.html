                <h1>What Is Humanistic Therapy?</h1>
                <p>  
                        Humanistic therapy is a mental health approach that emphasizes the importance of being your true self in order to lead the most fulfilling life.

                        It’s based on the principle that everyone has their own unique way of looking at the world. This view can impact your choices and actions.
                        
                        Humanistic therapy also involves a core belief that people are good at heart and capable of making the right choices for themselves. If you don’t hold yourself in high regard, it’s harder to develop your full potential.
                        
                        Read on to learn more about humanistic therapy, including how it works and tips for finding a therapist.
                        
                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                        Humanistic therapy involves better understanding your world view and developing true self-acceptance.
                        
                        This is accomplished partially through the development of unconditional positive regard, both from others and from yourself. When you believe that others only respect you if you act a certain way, it’s easy to fall into the trap of constantly feeling like you aren’t enough.
                        
                        This feeling of worthlessness, in turn, can negatively impact how you view both yourself and the world around you. Remember, according to the underlying principles of humanistic therapy, how you view yourself and the world around you has a big impact on your thoughts and actions.
                        
                        Humanistic therapy can help you to both develop self-acceptance and overcome criticism or disapproval from others by offering a safe space to work toward personal growth. There are ways of doing this, which we’ll go over later.
                        
                        <h2>How does it compare to other types of therapy?</h2>
                        Humanistic therapy differs from more traditional approaches, such as psychoanalysis or behavioral therapy.
                        
                        To start, humanistic therapy tends to focus more on your current day-to-day life. This is very different from other approaches that tend to focus on your past experiences, including those you might not be aware of.
                        
                        Similarly, humanistic therapy also focuses more on helping the individual as a whole, rather than treating a specific diagnosis. A humanistic therapist will often do this through active listening. This means that they’ll listen carefully to your words, making sure they fully understand what you’re saying. They may stop you to ask follow-up questions.
                        
                        Humanistic therapists work from the idea that you are the expert in your difficulties. They’ll support the direction you take each session, trusting you to know what you need to talk about in order to work through the things bringing you to therapy.      
               
                        <h2>What are some examples of humanistic therapy?</h2>
    Humanistic therapies include a number of approaches. Three of the most common are Gestalt therapy, client-centered therapy, and existential therapy.

<h2>Gestalt therapy</h2>
In Gestalt therapy, your personal experiences are key, along with describing what you’re going through in your own words. It’s based on an underlying theory that unresolved conflicts with others — including family members or romantic partners — lead to distress.

Gestalt therapy provides a state of “safe emergency” where you can explore, in the present moment, the things bothering you. For example, you might explore the belief that your opinions don’t matter to your partner.

Therapists help create the “here and now” atmosphere by asking what you’re currently aware of or how certain emotions make you feel. You might use a range of techniques to do this, including:

role-playing
exaggerating a behavior
reenacting a scenario
For example, you might be asked to visualize a person you’re having a conflict with sitting in an empty chair across from you. Then, you’ll carry out a conversation as if the person were actually sitting there.

<h2>Client-centered therapy</h2>
Also known as person-centered therapy and Rogerian therapy, this approach is considered the main type of humanistic therapy.

It’s based on the idea that absorbing criticism or disapproval from others can distort the way you see yourself. This blocks personal growth and prevents you from living a fulfilling life, which in turn leads to mental distress.

As the name suggests, it also places a lot of focus on developing a strong client-therapist relationship.

A client-centered therapist will unconditionally accept you, even if they disagree with some aspect of your behavior. Feeling accepted in therapy, no matter what you share, can help you avoid holding back out of fear of disapproval.

You’ll guide the direction of therapy while your therapist listens without judgement.

<h2>Existential therapy</h2>
Existential therapy draws more from philosophy than most other approaches to mental health treatment. The goal of this approach is to help you understand how your existence — the concept of you as a whole person — affects your unique worldview.

Existential therapists help you understand and explore the meaning you give to things that happen in your life. With their guidance, you’ll learn to accept responsibility for choices you make and realize the freedom you have to make changes that will give your life greater meaning.

Like other humanistic approaches, existential therapy is mainly concerned with the issues you currently face, rather than things from your past. But it does consider how your thoughts — conscious or unconscious — impact your mental health and goals.
